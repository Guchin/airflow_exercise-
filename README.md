# airflow_exercise

This code create two dimentions: Customers and Ads_Group. However, It's possible to work with a denormilized model so I kept the table as it was originally. Each Ad_groupID has its own ID even when is denormalize (with multiple values) so it makes perfect sense two work with the table as it comes.

Please refer to tha airflow.py file to see the ETL process
